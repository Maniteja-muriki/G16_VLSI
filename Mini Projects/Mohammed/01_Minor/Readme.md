# HDL BITS SOLUTION

HDLBits is a collection of small circuit design exercises for practicing digital hardware design using Verilog Hardware Description Language (HDL). Earlier problems follow a tutorial style, while later problems will increasingly challenge your circuit design skills.

Each problem requires you to design a small circuit in Verilog. HDLBits gives you immediate feedback on the circuit module you submit. Your circuit is checked for correctness by simulating with a set of test vectors and comparing it to our reference solution.

## Getting Started

 Getting started is just beginning of the hdl bits solutions.It teaches how to assign 1 and 0 to a variable in the binary form.

## Verilog Languages
 It has basics of the verilog language like logic gates, vectors, modules, procedures,etc

## Circuits
 In this topic we write code mainly for circuits like combinational circuits and sequential circuits.
 In the combination circuits we will see the following circuits

  + Multiplexers
  + Arthmetic Circuits
  + Karnaugh Map For Circuits

## In the sequential circuits we will see the following circuits

 + Latches and Filp Flops
 + Counters
 + Shift Registers
 + Finite State Machines

 ## Verification Parts
 #### 1.Verification:Reading Simulations
 + Finding Bugs in code
 + Build a circuit from a simulation waveform

 #### 2.Verification:Writing Testbenches
 + clock
 + Testbench1
 + And Gate
 + Testbench2
 + T Flip_Flop
