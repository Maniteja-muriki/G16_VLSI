 # <i> HDL BITS SOLUTIONS </i>

HDLBits is a collection of small circuit design exercises for practicing digital hardware design using Verilog Hardware Description Language (HDL). Earlier problems follow a tutorial style, while later problems will increasingly challenge your circuit design skills.

Each problem requires you to design a small circuit in Verilog. HDLBits gives you immediate feedback on the circuit module you submit. Your circuit is checked for correctness by simulating with a set of test vectors and comparing it to our reference solution.

#### <i> Getting Started </i>

Getting started is just beginning of the hdl bits solutions.It teaches how to assign 1 and 0 to a variable in the binary form.
#### <i>Verilog Languages</i>

It has basics of the verilog language we are going to see the following topics.
* Basics
* Vectors
* Modules Hierarchy
* Procedures
* More Verilog Features
#### <i> Circuits</i>
In this topic we write code mainly for circuits like combinational circuits, sequential circuits and Building Larger Circuits.</br>
In the <b>combination circuits </b> we will see the following circuits
* <i> Basic Gates 
* Multiplexers
* Arthmetic Circuits
* Karnaugh Map For Circuits </i>

In the <b> sequential circuits </b> we will see the following circuits
* <i> Latches and Filp Flops
* Counters
* Shift Registers 
* Finite State Machines
* More Circuits
</i>

#### <i> Verification Reading Simulations </i>
In this topic we going to see the following circuits
* <i>Build A Circuit From Simulation Waveform
* Finding Bugs In Code</i>
 
 #### <i>Verification Writing TestBenches </i>
 In this topic we will see how to write testbench for a circuit.
